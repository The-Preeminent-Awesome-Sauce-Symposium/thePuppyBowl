NEWS/Communication Board:

Whenever adding to the repository DO NOT pull anything onto the MAIN branch. Pull any coding work or anything else into the SECONDARY Main branch. That way we have space to work with. Normally we should be able to set up rules and lock out the main branch but we need special accounts for that. 

To make sure we dont mess up the main branch, I am making the secondary branch to provide space for error. That way if anything messes up its in the secondary Main branch and not the main main initial branch. 

So when we pull new branches only pull them into secondary Main, not into the Main branch. For now, lets just avoid the Main branch all together until we get the project done.

So the only people that should be comitting and pulling into the main branch are the github admins, anything else with the site and building it should go to the secondary Main.

Alright team. It seems like I got it up and running. Im going to be uploading my respository onto here as I work on it. Let me know what yall think in regards to what roles will be filled. Lets try to commmunicate on slack. Then collab on here. We can use the Tuesdays and Fridays Study times on Zoom which the school provides for us. We shoud use that as meeting points to discuss. What times works best for everyone? Tuesdays or Fridays? Ill post it on here as the metting day.
